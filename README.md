# Nexa

Nexa provides a unified, context-aware, and self-evolving entry point for mobile services.  

NexaServer serves as the backend implementation of Nexa.  


## ‚ú® Features

- üéØ **Unified Entry**: A unified entry point for all mobile services.  
- üåç **Context-Aware**: Supports multi-modal input, including user input (photos, voice, motion gestures, and circled screen content) and contextual data (time, location, activity, network status, etc.) to access mobile services.  
- üå± **Self-Evolving**: Learn from user phone usage to expand the service and rule databases for future service recommendation. 

## üîß Implementation
### Implemented Services
The system currently supports the following services:
- Snap-to-Shop  
- Add to Calendar  
- Set Alarm  
- Check Weather  
- Image Q&A  
- Online Search  
- Reply Assistant  
- Text Translation  
- App Search  

### Service Recommendation Module
The service recommendation module adopts a dual-process design:
- **System 1**: Performs fast, rule-based matching for immediate predictions.  
- **System 2**: Falls back to LLM-based reasoning when no predefined rule applies.  

Rules are represented in an **IF‚ÄìTHEN** format:  
- The **IF** part may consist of one or more predicates combined with logical AND (e.g., *screen content contains `<clothes>`*).  
- The **THEN** part specifies the target service, defined by its intent, associated slots, and the app name (e.g., *query_weather(location, date, app)*).

### Reflection Module (In Progress)
The reflection module, which is responsible for analyzing user interactions and generating new rules (self-evolving capability), is being integrated and should be completed soon.
